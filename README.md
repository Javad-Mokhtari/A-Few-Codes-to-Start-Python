This repository includes a few simple examples of functions, algorithms, drawings, and some Python libraries.

# Random Walk Algorithm
In mathematics, a random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.</p>
<p align="justify">
In the above code, we move randomly in one of the four directions up ٫ down ٫ left or right in a n×n network and it specifies the percentage of times the stimulus reaches a dead end.

# Tower of Hanoi Problem
<p align="justify">
The tower of Hanoi puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size, the smallest at the top, thus approximating a conical shape. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to the last rod, obeying the following rules:</p>
1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2^n − 1, where n is the number of disks. In above code, we can see the order in which the disks are moved.


# Gray Code
<p align="justify">
The reflected binary code (RBC), also known just as reflected binary (RB) or Gray code after Frank Gray, is an ordering of the binary numeral system such that two successive values differ in only one bit (binary digit). For example, the representation of the decimal value "1" in binary would normally be "001" and "2" would be "010". In Gray code, these values are represented as "001" and "011". That way, incrementing a value from 1 to 2 requires only one bit to change, instead of two. Gray codes are widely used to prevent spurious output from electromechanical switches and to facilitate error correction in digital communications such as digital terrestrial television and some cable TV systems.

# Chaos Game
The game on an equilateral triangle with three vertices R, G and B is defined as follows:
1. We start from one vertex and repeat the next steps n times.
2. We choose a vertex randomly.
3. From the beginning to the selected vertex, we walk halfway.
4. In this place we create a dot in the color of the selected vertex.
<p align="justify">
The more times this algorithm is executed, the more complete the resulting image will be and finally the **Sierpinski triangle** will be seen.
Sierpinski triangle is a fractal attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets; That is, it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction. It is named after the Polish mathematician Wacław Sierpiński, but appeared as a decorative pattern many centuries before the work of Sierpinski.

# H-Tree Data Structure
<p align="justify">
In fractal geometry, the H tree, or T-branching, is a fractal tree structure constructed from perpendicular line segments, each smaller by a factor of the square root of 2 from the next larger adjacent segment. It is so called because its repeating pattern resembles the letter "H". It has Hausdorff dimension 2, and comes arbitrarily close to every point in a rectangle. Its applications include VLSI design and microwave engineering.

# Bouncing Ball
<p align="justify">
In the bouncing ball code, a ball moves on a square plate with a specified velocity vector and whenever it strikes the walls, returns from the wall at the same angle of impact.
