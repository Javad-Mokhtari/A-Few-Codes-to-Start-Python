# Random Walk Algorithm
In mathematics, a random walk is a mathematical object, known as a stochastic or random process, that describes a path that consists of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space such as the integers.
In the above code, we move randomly in one of the four directions up ٫ down ٫ left or right in a n×n network and it specifies the percentage of times the stimulus reaches a dead end.
