# **Classic Algorithms**
## Implementation of some classic algorithms with Python
<p align="justify">This repository contains some classic algorithms in computer science. Currently, it includes two folders: the DesignPattern folder, 
  which implements some algorithms in Python to get started with the language, and the MachineLearning folder, which includes the implementation of 
  some basic machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more. Inside each folder, there are further descriptions for 
  the algorithms and their implementation.</p>
