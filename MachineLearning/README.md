# **Machine Learning Classic Algorithms from Scratch**

## Naive Bayes
<p align="justify">Naive Bayes is a probabilistic algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem, which provides a way to calculate the probability of a hypothesis given evidence. Naive Bayes assumes that the features are independent of each other, which is not always true in real-world scenarios. Despite this, it is often used in practical applications because of its simplicity and efficiency. Naive Bayes can handle large datasets and has low computational cost.

## KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
<p align="justify">KNN is a non-parametric algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by finding the k-nearest neighbors 
to a new data point, and then using the labels or values of those neighbors to predict the label or value of the new point. KNN can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets, but it can be an effective algorithm when the underlying structure of the data is complex.</p>

## K-means
<p align="justify">K-means is a clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into k clusters. It works by iteratively assigning each data point to the cluster whose centroid is closest, and then updating the centroids based on the new assignments. K-means is a simple and fast algorithm, but it can be sensitive to the initial choice of centroids and can sometimes converge to a suboptimal solution.

## MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
<p align="justify">MLP is a type of artificial neural network that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It consists of multiple layers of interconnected neurons, where each neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs and applies a non-linear activation function. MLP is a powerful algorithm that can learn complex relationships in data, but it can be prone to overfitting and can require careful tuning of its hyperparameters.

## RBF (Radial Basis Function):
<p align="justify">RBF is a type of artificial neural network that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It consists of multiple layers of neurons, where each neuron applies a radial basis function to its inputs. RBF is a powerful algorithm that can learn complex relationships in data, but it can be computationally expensive and can require careful tuning of its hyperparameters.
</p>

## SOM (Self-Organizing Map)
<p align="justify">SOM is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering and visualization tasks. It works by mapping a high-dimensional input space onto a low-dimensional grid of neurons, where each neuron represents a region of the input space. SOM is a powerful algorithm for visualizing high-dimensional data, but it can be sensitive to the initial configuration of the map and can require careful tuning of its hyperparameters.</p>
